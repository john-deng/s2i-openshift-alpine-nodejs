This is the alpine-nodejs S2I image:
To use it, install S2I: https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image

Sample invocation:

s2i build <source code path/URL> alpine-nodejs <application image>

You can then run the resulting image via:
docker run -p 3000:3000 <application image>

This base image also provides the default user you should use to run your
application. Your Dockerfile should include this instruction after you finish
installing software:

USER default

The default directory for installing your application sources is
'/opt/app-root/src' and the WORKDIR and HOME for the 'default' user is set
to this directory as well. In your S2I scripts, you don't have to use absolute
path, but rather rely on the relative path.

In Openshift if you want to checkout code with an untrusted CA do this
oc set env bc/<service-name> --env=GIT_SSL_NO_VERIFY=true
